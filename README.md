# TIVA Task Scheduler
A simple priority based task scheduler for TIVA boards utilizing Tivaware.

If you'd like to use this in your project, just let me know, because I'd love to see your project :). If you cannot disclose that information, then you probably should be using better code than mine.

Task priority is ordered lowest->highest, so the lower the number the higher the priority.

The scheduler was tested on a Tiva tm4c129ncpdt and Tiva tm4c123gh6pm but should be compatible with all tivas.
